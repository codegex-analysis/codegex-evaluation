DEFINITIONS</b></p>\n-\n-<p>&quot;Contribution&quot; means:</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial\n-code and documentation distributed under this Agreement, and</p>\n-<p class=\"list\">b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:</p>\n-<p class=\"list\">i) changes to the Program, and</p>\n-<p class=\"list\">ii) additions to the Program;</p>\n-<p class=\"list\">where such changes and/or additions to the Program\n-originate from and are distributed by that particular Contributor. A\n-Contribution 'originates' from a Contributor if it was added to the\n-Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such\n-Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to the\n-Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in\n-conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii)\n-are not derivative works of the Program.</p>\n-\n-<p>&quot;Contributor&quot; means any person or entity that distributes\n-the Program.</p>\n-\n-<p>&quot;Licensed Patents&quot; mean patent claims licensable by a\n-Contributor which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its\n-Contribution alone or when combined with the Program.</p>\n-\n-<p>&quot;Program&quot; means the Contributions distributed in accordance\n-with this Agreement.</p>\n-\n-<p>&quot;Recipient&quot; means anyone who receives the Program under\n-this Agreement, including all Contributors.</p>\n-\n-<p><b>2. GRANT OF RIGHTS</b></p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each\n-Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n-royalty-free copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works\n-of, publicly display, publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the\n-Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in\n-source code and object code form.</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each\n-Contributor hereby grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide,\n-royalty-free patent license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell,\n-offer to sell, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such\n-Contributor, if any, in source code and object code form. This patent\n-license shall apply to the combination of the Contribution and the\n-Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor,\n-such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered\n-by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n-combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n-licensed hereunder.</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor\n-grants the licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances\n-are provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n-patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each\n-Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by\n-any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights\n-or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses\n-granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility to\n-secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For\n-example, if a third party patent license is required to allow Recipient\n-to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire\n-that license before distributing the Program.</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it\n-has sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n-the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.</p>\n-\n-<p><b>3. REQUIREMENTS</b></p>\n-\n-<p>A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code\n-form under its own license agreement, provided that:</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this\n-Agreement; and</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">b) its license agreement:</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors\n-all warranties and conditions, express and implied, including warranties\n-or conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or\n-conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors\n-all liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n-incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">iii) states that any provisions which differ from this\n-Agreement are offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other\n-party; and</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">iv) states that source code for the Program is available\n-from such Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a\n-reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for software\n-exchange.</p>\n-\n-<p>When the Program is made available in source code form:</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and</p>\n-\n-<p class=\"list\">b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each\n-copy of the Program.</p>\n-\n-<p>Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained\n-within the Program.</p>\n-\n-<p>Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its\n-Contribution, if any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent\n-Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.</p>\n-\n-<p><b>4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION</b></p>\n-\n-<p>Commercial distributors of software may accept certain\n-responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the\n-like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of\n-the Program, the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial\n-product offering should do so in a manner which does not create\n-potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor\n-includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n-(&quot;Commercial Contributor&quot;) hereby agrees to defend and\n-indemnify every other Contributor (&quot;Indemnified Contributor&quot;)\n-against any losses, damages and costs (collectively &quot;Losses&quot;)\n-arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third\n-party against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the\n-acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in connection with its\n-distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The\n-obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses\n-relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In\n-order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify\n-the Commercial Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the\n-Commercial Contributor to control, and cooperate with the Commercial\n-Contributor in, the defense and any related settlement negotiations. The\n-Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such claim at its own\n-expense.</p>\n-\n-<p>For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\n-product offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\n-Contributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\n-claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\n-claims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\n-alone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\n-defend claims against the other Contributors related to those\n-performance claims and warranties, and if a court requires any other\n-Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor\n-must pay those damages.</p>\n-\n-<p><b>5. NO WARRANTY</b></p>\n-\n-<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS\n-PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS\n-OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n-ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY\n-OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely\n-responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and\n-distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its\n-exercise of rights under this Agreement , including but not limited to\n-the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws,\n-damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or\n-interruption of operations.</p>\n-\n-<p><b>6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY</b></p>\n-\n-<p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT\n-NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,\n-INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING\n-WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF\n-LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING\n-NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR\n-DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED\n-HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>\n-\n-<p><b>7. GENERAL</b></p>\n-\n-<p>If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\n-applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n-the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further action\n-by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum\n-extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.</p>\n-\n-<p>If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n-(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\n-Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other\n-software or hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such\n-Recipient's rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the\n-date such litigation is filed.</p>\n-\n-<p>All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\n-fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\n-Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time\n-after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights\n-under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use and\n-distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable. However,\n-Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses granted by\n-Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.</p>\n-\n-<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this\n-Agreement, but in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is\n-copyrighted and may only be modified in the following manner. The\n-Agreement Steward reserves the right to publish new versions (including\n-revisions) of this Agreement from time to time. No one other than the\n-Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse\n-Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may\n-assign the responsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a\n-suitable separate entity. Each new version of the Agreement will be\n-given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including\n-Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the\n-Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version\n-of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the\n-Program (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as\n-expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no\n-rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any Contributor under\n-this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or\n-otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted under this\n-Agreement are reserved.</p>\n-\n-<p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and\n-the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No party\n-to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement more\n-than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives its\n-rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.</p>\n-\n-</body>\n-\n-</html>\n\\ No newline at end of file"

It also counts\n- as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence\n- the version number 2.1.]\n-</pre>\n-\n-\n-<h3><a id=\"SEC2\">Preamble</a></h3>\n-\n-<p>\n-  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your\n-freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change\n-free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some\n-specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the\n-Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You\n-can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether\n-this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better\n-strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,\n-not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that\n-you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge\n-for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get\n-it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of\n-it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do\n-these things.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these\n-rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for\n-you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis\n-or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave\n-you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source\n-code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide\n-complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them\n-with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling\n-it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the\n-library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal\n-permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that\n-there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is\n-modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know\n-that what they have is not the original version, so that the original\n-author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be\n-introduced by others.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of\n-any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot\n-effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a\n-restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that\n-any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be\n-consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser\n-General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and\n-is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use\n-this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those\n-libraries into non-free programs.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using\n-a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a\n-combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary\n-General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the\n-entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General\n-Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with\n-the library.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it\n-does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General\n-Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less\n-of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages\n-are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many\n-libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain\n-special circumstances.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to\n-encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes\n-a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be\n-allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free\n-library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this\n-case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free\n-software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free\n-programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of\n-free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in\n-non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU\n-operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating\n-system.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the\n-users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is\n-linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run\n-that program using a modified version of the Library.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a\n-\"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The\n-former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must\n-be combined with the library in order to run.\n-</p>\n-\n-<h3><a id=\"SEC3\">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING,\n-DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</a></h3>\n-\n-\n-<p>\n-<strong>0.</strong>\n-This License Agreement applies to any software library or other\n-program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or\n-other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of\n-this Lesser General Public License (also called \"this License\").\n-Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data\n-prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs\n-(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work\n-which has been distributed under these terms.  A \"work based on the\n-Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under\n-copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a\n-portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated\n-straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is\n-included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for\n-making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means\n-all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated\n-interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation\n-and installation of the library.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from\n-such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based\n-on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for\n-writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does\n-and what the program that uses the Library does.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>1.</strong>\n-You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's\n-complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that\n-you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an\n-appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact\n-all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any\n-warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the\n-Library.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,\n-and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a\n-fee.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>2.</strong>\n-You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n-above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n-</p>\n-\n-<ul>\n-  <li><strong>a)</strong>\n-       The modified work must itself be a software library.</li>\n-  <li><strong>b)</strong>\n-       You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices\n-       stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</li>\n-\n-  <li><strong>c)</strong>\n-       You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no\n-       charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</li>\n-\n-  <li><strong>d)</strong>\n-       If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a\n-       table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses\n-       the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility\n-       is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,\n-       in the event an application does not supply such function or\n-       table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of\n-       its purpose remains meaningful.\n-       <p>\n-       (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has\n-       a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the\n-       application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any\n-       application-supplied function or table used by this function must\n-       be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square\n-       root function must still compute square roots.)</p></li>\n-</ul>\n-\n-<p>\n-These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable\n-sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be\n-reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then\n-this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you\n-distribute them as separate works.  But when you distribute the same\n-sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the\n-distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose\n-permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to\n-each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your\n-rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise\n-the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works\n-based on the Library.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with\n-the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage\n-or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of\n-this License.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>3.</strong>\n-You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public\n-License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do\n-this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so\n-that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,\n-instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the\n-ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify\n-that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in\n-these notices.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for\n-that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all\n-subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of\n-the Library into a program that is not a library.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>4.</strong>\n-You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or\n-derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form\n-under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany\n-it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which\n-must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a\n-medium customarily used for software interchange.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy\n-from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the\n-source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to\n-distribute the source code, even though third parties are not\n-compelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>5.</strong>\n-A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the\n-Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or\n-linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\".  Such a\n-work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and\n-therefore falls outside the scope of this License.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library\n-creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it\n-contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the\n-library\".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.\n-Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file\n-that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a\n-derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.\n-Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be\n-linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The\n-threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data\n-structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline\n-functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object\n-file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative\n-work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the\n-Library will still fall under Section 6.)\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may\n-distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.\n-Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,\n-whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>6.</strong>\n-As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or\n-link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a\n-work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work\n-under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit\n-modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse\n-engineering for debugging such modifications.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the\n-Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by\n-this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work\n-during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the\n-copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference\n-directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one\n-of these things:\n-</p>\n-\n-<ul>\n-    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the work with the complete\n-    corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library\n-    including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be\n-    distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an\n-    executable linked with the Library, with the complete\n-    machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code\n-    and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and\n-    then relink to produce a modified executable containing the\n-    modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who changes the\n-    contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily\n-    be able to recompile the application to use the modified\n-    definitions.)</li>\n-\n-    <li><strong>b)</strong> Use a suitable shared library mechanism\n-    for linking with the Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that\n-    (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the\n-    user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into\n-    the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified\n-    version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the\n-    modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the\n-    work was made with.</li>\n-\n-    <li><strong>c)</strong> Accompany the work with a written offer,\n-    valid for at least three years, to give the same user the\n-    materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more\n-    than the cost of performing this distribution.</li>\n-\n-    <li><strong>d)</strong> If distribution of the work is made by\n-    offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent\n-    access to copy the above specified materials from the same\n-    place.</li>\n-\n-    <li><strong>e)</strong> Verify that the user has already received\n-    a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user\n-    a copy.</li>\n-</ul>\n-\n-<p>\n-  For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the\n-Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for\n-reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,\n-the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is\n-normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major\n-components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on\n-which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies\n-the executable.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license\n-restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally\n-accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot\n-use both them and the Library together in an executable that you\n-distribute.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>7.</strong> You may place library facilities that are a work\n-based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with\n-other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute\n-such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of\n-the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is\n-otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things:\n-</p>\n-\n-<ul>\n-    <li><strong>a)</strong> Accompany the combined library with a copy\n-    of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other\n-    library facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of\n-    the Sections above.</li>\n-\n-    <li><strong>b)</strong> Give prominent notice with the combined\n-    library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the\n-    Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined\n-    form of the same work.</li>\n-</ul>\n-\n-<p>\n-<strong>8.</strong> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with,\n-or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this\n-License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link\n-with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically\n-terminate your rights under this License.  However, parties who have\n-received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have\n-their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full\n-compliance.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>9.</strong>\n-You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\n-signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\n-distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are\n-prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\n-modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\n-all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\n-the Library or works based on it.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>10.</strong>\n-Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the\n-Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\n-original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library\n-subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\n-restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\n-You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with\n-this License.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>11.</strong>\n-If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\n-infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\n-conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\n-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\n-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\n-distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\n-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\n-may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent\n-license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by\n-all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\n-the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\n-refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any\n-particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,\n-and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\n-patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\n-such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\n-integrity of the free software distribution system which is\n-implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\n-generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\n-through that system in reliance on consistent application of that\n-system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\n-to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\n-impose that choice.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\n-be a consequence of the rest of this License.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>12.</strong>\n-If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in\n-certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\n-original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add\n-an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,\n-so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus\n-excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if\n-written in the body of this License.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>13.</strong>\n-The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new\n-versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.\n-Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,\n-but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library\n-specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and\n-\"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and\n-conditions either of that version or of any later version published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a\n-license version number, you may choose any version ever published by\n-the Free Software Foundation.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>14.</strong>\n-If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free\n-programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,\n-write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is\n-copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free\n-Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our\n-decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status\n-of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing\n-and reuse of software generally.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>NO WARRANTY</strong>\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>15.</strong>\n-BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO\n-WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.\n-EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR\n-OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY\n-KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\n-IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\n-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE\n-LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME\n-THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-<strong>16.</strong>\n-IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN\n-WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY\n-AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU\n-FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR\n-CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE\n-LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING\n-RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A\n-FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF\n-SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n-DAMAGES.\n-</p>\n-\n-<h3>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>\n-\n-<h3><a id=\"SEC4\">How to Apply These Terms to Your New\n-Libraries</a></h3>\n-<p>\n-  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest\n-possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that\n-everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting\n-redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the\n-ordinary General Public License).\n-</p>\n-<p>\n-  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is\n-safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n-convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the\n-\"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n-</p>\n-\n-<pre>\n-<var>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.</var>\n-Copyright (C) <var>year</var>  <var>name of author</var>\n-\n-This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n-modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\n-License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\n-version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n-\n-This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n-but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n-MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
