However, Tensorflow Core is in the process of migrating gradient definitions to [`c/experimental/gradients`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/c/experimental/gradients), which will be what our eager mode uses once it has gradient support. Anyone adding gradients is strongly encouraged to add one there as well, and eventually it should replace the legacy `cc/gradients` gradients."
