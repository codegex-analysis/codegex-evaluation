The DejaVu fonts are a font family based on the Bitstream Vera Fonts. Its purpose is to provide a wider range of characters while maintaining the original look and feel through the process of collaborative development.\n \n-### Gosu\n-[Gosu](https://github.com/tianon/gosu/) is pre-installed in the container. Gosu allows derived images to run commands as a specified user, rather than as the default user.  \n-\n-To use gosu, set the `RUNAS_USER` environment variable in the derived container's Dockerfile.
