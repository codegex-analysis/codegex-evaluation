An Ed25519 key \"signs\" a scheduled transaction\n+by signing an ordinary transaction that either creates or affirms the \n+schedule entity.\n+\n+Along with a scheduled transaction, a schedule entity (or simply _schedule_) also contains,\n+  1. An optional memo. \n+  2. An optional admin key that can be used to delete the schedule.\n+  3. An optional account to be charged the service fee for the scheduled transaction.\n+  4. A list of the Ed25519 keys that the network deems to have signed the scheduled transaction.\n+\n+The schedule entity type is managed by four new HAPI operations,\n+  1. The `ScheduleCreate` transaction creates a new schedule (possibly with a non-empty list of signing keys).\n+  2. The `ScheduleSign` transaction adds one or more Ed25519 keys to a schedule's list of affirmed signers.\n+  3. The `ScheduleDelete` transaction marks a schedule as deleted; its transaction will not be executed.\n+  4. The `GetScheduleInfo` query gets the current state of a schedule.\n+\n+It is important to understand that the bytes of the inner scheduled transaction are never \n+directly signed by an Ed25519 key. Only `ScheduleCreate` or `ScheduleSign` bytes\n+are ever signed, in the ordinary way. \n+\n+## Ready-to-execute status\n+\n+A scheduled transaction is _ready-to-execute_ if its schedule has a list of \n+Ed25519 signing keys which, taken together, meet the _signing requirements_ of all the\n+Hedera keys _prerequisite_ to the scheduled transaction. (See the \n+[next section](#prerequisite-signing-keys) for more discussion on prerequisite keys.)\n+\n+Because Hedera keys can include key lists and threshold keys, sometimes there are \n+many different lists of Ed25519 signing keys which could meet a Hedera key's signing \n+requirements. \n+\n+For example, suppose Alice has an account whose key is a 1-of-3 threshold made up of \n+Ed25519 keys `KeyA`, `KeyB`, and `KeyC`.  As long as any of `KeyA`, `KeyB`, or `KeyC` have signed, \n+the signing requirement for the Hedera key on Alice's account is met.\n+\n+(We often say a Hedera key has \"signed a transaction\" when enough Ed25519 keys\n+have signed to meet the Hedera key's signing requirements; but notice this is \n+a bit imprecise---only Ed25519 keys ever \"sign\" in the cryptographic sense.)\n+\n+### Prerequisite signing keys\n+\n+First, if a schedule lists an account to be charged the service fee for\n+its scheduled transaction, the Hedera key of that account is prerequisite \n+to the scheduled transaction.\n+\n+Second, if some non-payer Hedera key would need to sign a scheduled transaction \n+if it was submitted directly to the network, that non-payer key is prerequisite\n+to the scheduled transaction. Consider three examples.\n+  1. A scheduled `CryptoTransfer` of 1ℏ from account `0.0.X` to account `0.0.Y`,\n+     which has `receiverSigRequired=true`. The keys on accounts `0.0.X` and\n+     `0.0.Y` are both prerequisite.\n+  2. A scheduled `SubmitMessage` to a topic `0.0.Z` which has a submit key. The\n+     submit key on topic `0.0.Z` is prerequisite.\n+  3. A scheduled `TokenMint` for a token `0.0.T` with a supply key. The supply\n+     key on token `0.0.T` is prerequisite. (Although `TokenMint` is \n+     not currently in the [scheduling whitelist](https://github.com/hashgraph/hedera-services/blob/master/hedera-node/src/main/resources/bootstrap.properties#L64),\n+     eventually all transaction types will be.)\n+\n+## Triggered execution\n+\n+A schedule is _triggered_ when the network handles a `ScheduleCreate` \n+or `ScheduleSign` that adds enough signing keys to make its scheduled\n+transaction ready-to-execute. (You may create a schedule whose initial \n+signing keys are already triggering.) A scheduled transaction executes \n+immediately after its schedule is triggered. \n+\n+It is crucial to understand that in Hedera Services 0.13.0, a scheduled \n+transaction **only** executes when its schedule is triggered by a \n+`ScheduleCreate` or `ScheduleSign`! The network does not proactively monitor \n+how changes to Hedera keys may impact the ready-to-execute status of \n+existing scheduled transactions.\n+ \n+For example, suppose the Hedera key on account `0.0.X` is a key list of two\n+Ed25519 keys `KeyA` and `KeyB`; and is the sole prerequisite to a scheduled transaction \n+whose schedule `0.0.S` already lists `A` as a signer. Say we now update account \n+`0.0.X` to remove `KeyB` from its key. Schedule `0.0.S` is **not** automatically\n+triggered! We need to submit a `ScheduleSign` for `0.0.S` to trigger it. (This\n+`ScheduleSign` can be signed by just a payer key, since we made the scheduled\n+transaction ready-to-execute by weakening the signing requirement for the key\n+on account `0.0.X`.)\n+\n+## The `ScheduleCreate` transaction\n+  \n+```  \n+message ScheduleCreateTransactionBody {  \n+  SchedulableTransactionBody scheduledTransactionBody = 1; // The scheduled transaction\n+  string memo = 2; // An optional memo with a UTF-8 encoding of no more than 100 bytes\n+  Key adminKey = 3; // An optional Hedera key which can be used to sign a `ScheduleDelete` and make the schedule un-triggerable\n+  AccountID payerAccountID = 4; // An optional id of the account to be charged the service fee for the scheduled transaction at the consensus time that it executes (if ever); defaults to the `ScheduleCreate` payer if not given\n+}  \n+```  \n+\n+The new `SchedulableTransactionBody` message is a strict subset of the `TransactionBody` message which omits the\n+top-level `TransactionID`, `nodeAccountID`, and `transactionValidDuration` fields; and does not allow the \n+`ScheduleCreateTransactionBody` and `ScheduleSignTransactionBody` messages in its `data` element. Any \n+unknown fields in the submitted `SchedulableTransactionBody` will be ignored, although they _will_ affect\n+the \"identity\" of the schedule (see [below](#receipts-and-duplicate-creations)).\n+\n+As with all other entity types, a schedule remains in network state until it expires, even if its scheduled \n+transaction has already been executed or it has been marked deleted.\n+\n+### Paying for scheduled transactions\n+\n+If the `ScheduleCreate` gives a `payerAccountID`, the network will charge this payer the service fee \n+for the scheduled transaction at the consensus time that it executes (if ever). If no such payer is specified, \n+the network will charge the payer of the originating `ScheduleCreate`.\n+\n+### Receipts and duplicate creations\n+\n+When a `ScheduleCreate` resolves to `SUCCESS`, its receipt includes a new `ScheduleID` field\n+with the id of the created schedule. Its receipt _also_ includes a new \n+`scheduledTransactionID` field with the `TransactionID` that can be used to query for the \n+record of the scheduled transaction's execution. \n+\n+This `scheduledTransactionID` will be the `TransactionID` of the `ScheduleCreate`, \n+with a new additional field `scheduled=true`.  However, clients should always use the id \n+from the receipt instead of relying on this correspondence.\n+\n+#### Duplicate creations\n+There is a special case in which a `ScheduleCreate` transaction tries to re-create a\n+schedule that already exists in state. When this happens, the `ScheduleCreate` resolves \n+to a new status of `IDENTICAL_SCHEDULE_ALREADY_CREATED`, and the `ScheduleID` in its receipt points\n+to the existing schedule. (It also contains the `TransactionID` used to query for the\n+record of the existing scheduled transaction.) A client receiving `IDENTICAL_SCHEDULE_ALREADY_CREATED` \n+can then submit a `ScheduleSign` (see below) with the given `ScheduleID`, signing with\n+the same Ed25519 keys it used for its own create attempt. \n+\n+Two <tt>ScheduleCreate</tt> transactions are <i>identical</i> if they are equal in all their fields \n+other than, possibly, <tt>payerAccountID</tt>. (Here \"equal\" should be understood in the sense of \n+gRPC object equality in the network software runtime. In particular, a gRPC object with \n+[unknown fields](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#unknowns)\n+is not equal to a gRPC object without unknown fields, even if they agree on all known fields.)\n+  \n+### Enforced checks and the scheduling whitelist\n+\n+The only body-specific precheck enforced for a `ScheduleCreate` transaction is that the \n+`memo` field is valid. At consensus, the following checks are enforced:\n+  1. The `memo` must be valid.\n+  2. The type of the `scheduledTransactionBody` must be in the `scheduling.whitelist`; and it \n+     must reference only non-deleted entities that exist in state at the time the `ScheduleCreate` \n+     reaches consensus. \n+  3. The `adminKey` must be valid, if present.\n+  \n+## The `ScheduleSign` transaction\n+  \n+```  \n+message ScheduleSignTransactionBody {  \n+  ScheduleID scheduleID = 1; // The id of an existing schedule to affirm signing keys for\n+}  \n+```  \n+\n+Suppose we use the `scheduleID` field to point to schedule `0.0.12345`, which contains a \n+scheduled transaction `X`. If any of the Ed25519 keys required to sign `X` sign \n+our `ScheduleSign` ordinary transaction, then the network will update the state of \n+schedule `0.0.12345` with these keys.\n+\n+(It is permissible, though pointless, to sign the `ScheduleSign` with keys not \n+required for the execution of `X`.)\n+\n+### Receipts\n+\n+When a `ScheduleSign` resolves to `SUCCESS`, its receipt includes a new \n+`scheduledTransactionID` field which is the `TransactionID` that can be used to query \n+for the record of the execution of the scheduled transaction in the signed schedule.\n+  \n+## The `ScheduleDelete` transaction\n+  \n+```  \n+message ScheduleDeleteTransactionBody {  \n+  ScheduleID scheduleID = 1; // The id of an existing schedule to delete\n+}  \n+```  \n+\n+When a `ScheduleDelete` resolves to `SUCCESS`, its target schedule is marked as \n+as deleted. Any future attempts to trigger this schedule will result in `SCHEDULE_WAS_DELETED`.\n+However, the schedule will remain in network state until it expires. (Note that if we try \n+to delete a schedule that already executed, our `ScheduleDelete` will resolve\n+to `SCHEDULE_WAS_EXECUTED` and have no effect.)\n+  \n+## The `ScheduleGetInfo` query\n+  \n+```  \n+message ScheduleGetInfoQuery {  \n+  QueryHeader header = 1; // Standard query metadata, including payment\n+  ScheduleID schedule = 2; // The id of an existing schedule\n+}  \n+  \n+message ScheduleGetInfoResponse {  \n+  ScheduleID scheduleID = 1; // The id of the schedule\n+  Timestamp deletionTime = 2; // If the schedule has been deleted, the consensus time when this occurred\n+  Timestamp executionTime = 3; // If the schedule has been executed, the consensus time when this occurred\n+  Timestamp expirationTime = 4; // The time at which the schedule will expire\n+  SchedulableTransactionBody scheduledTransactionBody = 5; // The scheduled transaction\n+  string memo = 6; // The publicly visible memo of the schedule\n+  Key adminKey = 7; // The key used to delete the schedule from state\n+  KeyList signers = 8; // The Ed25519 keys the network deems to have signed the scheduled transaction\n+  AccountID creatorAccountID = 9; // The id of the account that created the schedule\n+  AccountID payerAccountID = 10; // The id of the account responsible for the service fee of the scheduled transaction\n+  TransactionID scheduledTransactionID = 11; // The transaction id that will be used in the record of the scheduled transaction (if it executes)\n+}  \n+```  \n+  \n+## Records of scheduled transactions\n+\n+Just as an ordinary transaction, a scheduled transaction that achieves execution has a unique consensus timestamp.\n+It also has a record in the record stream. However, there _are_ two items that distinguish the record of a \n+scheduled transaction.\n+  1. Its `TransactionID` will contain the new `scheduled=true` flag.\n+  2. It will have a new `scheduleRef` field with the `ScheduleID` of the schedule that managed its execution."
