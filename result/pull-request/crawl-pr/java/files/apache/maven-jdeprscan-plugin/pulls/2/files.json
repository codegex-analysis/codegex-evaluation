Best practice is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull\n+  request title and in the first line of the commit message.\n+- [ ] Write a pull request description that is detailed enough to understand what the pull request does, how, and why.\n+- [ ] Run `mvn clean verify` to make sure basic checks pass.
