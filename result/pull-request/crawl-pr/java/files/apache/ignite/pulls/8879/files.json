The directory contains the source files, HTML templates and css styles.\n+\n+\n+The Apache Ignite documentation is written in link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/what-is-asciidoc/[asciidoc].\n+The Asciidoc files are compiled into HTML pages and published to https://ignite.apache.org/docs.\n+\n+\n+.Content of the “docs” directory\n+[cols=\"1,4\",opts=\"stretch\"]\n+|===\n+| pass:[_]docs  | The directory with .adoc files and code-snippets.\n+| pass:[_]config.yml | Jekyll configuration file.\n+|===\n+\n+\n+== Building the Docs Locally\n+\n+To build the docs locally, you can install `jekyll` and other dependencies on your machine, or you can use Jekyll docker image.\n+\n+=== Install Jekyll and Asciidoctor\n+\n+. Install Jekyll by following this instruction:  https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/[window=_blank]\n+. In the “/docs” directory, run the following command:\n++\n+[source, shell]\n+----\n+$ bundle\n+----\n++\n+This should install all dependencies, including `asciidoctor`.\n+. Start jekyll:\n++\n+[source, shell]\n+----\n+$ bundle exec jekyll s\n+----\n+The command compiles the Asciidoc files into HTML pages and starts a local webserver.\n+\n+Open `http://localhost:4000/docs[window=_blank]` in your browser.\n+\n+=== Run with Docker\n+\n+The following command starts jekyll in a container and downloads all dependencies. Run the command in the “/docs” directory.\n+\n+[source, shell]\n+----\n+$ docker run -v \"$PWD:/srv/jekyll\" -p 4000:4000 jekyll/jekyll:latest jekyll s\n+----\n+\n+Open `http://localhost:4000/docs[window=_blank]` in your browser.\n+\n+== How to Contribute\n+\n+If you want to contribute to the documentation, add or modify the relevant page in the `docs/_docs` directory.\n+This directory contains all .adoc files (which are then rendered into HTML pages and published on the web-site).\n+\n+Because we use asciidoc for documentation, consider the following points:\n+\n+* Get familiar with the asciidoc format: https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/. You don’t have to read the entire manual. Search through it when you want to learn how to create a numbered list, or insert an image, or use italics.\n+* Please read the link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-recommended-practices:[AsciiDoc Recommended Practices] and try to adhere to those when editing the .adoc source files.\n+\n+\n+The following sections explain specific asciidoc syntax that we use.\n+\n+=== Table of content\n+\n+The table of content is defined in the `_data/toc.yaml` file.\n+If you want to add a new page, make sure to update the TOC.\n+\n+=== Links to other sections in the docs\n+All .adoc files are located in the \"docs/_docs\" directory.\n+Any link to the files within the directory must be relative to that directory.\n+Remove the file extension (.adoc).\n+\n+For example:\n+[source, adoc]\n+----\n+link:persistence/native-persistence[Native Persistence]\n+----\n+\n+This is a link to the Native Persistence page.\n+\n+=== Links to external resources\n+\n+When referencing an external resource, make the link to open in a new window by adding the `window=_blank` attribute:\n+\n+[source, adoc]\n+----\n+link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html#SunJSSE_Protocols[Supported protocols,window=_blank]\n+----\n+\n+\n+=== Tabs\n+\n+We use custom syntax to insert tabs. Tabs are used to provide code samples for different programming languages.\n+\n+Tabs are defined by the `tabs` block:\n+```\n+[tabs]\n+--\n+individual tabs are defined here\n+--\n+```\n+\n+Each tab is defined by the 'tab' directive:\n+\n+```\n+tab:tab_name[]\n+```\n+\n+where `tab_name` is the title of the tab.\n+\n+The content of the tab is everything that is given between the tab title, and the next tab or the end of the block.\n+\n+```asciidoc\n+[tabs]\n+--\n+tab:XML[]\n+\n+The content of the XML tab goes here\n+\n+tab:Java[]\n+\n+The content of the Java tab is here\n+\n+tab:C#/.NET[]\n+\n+tab:C++[unsupported]\n+\n+--\n+```\n+\n+=== Code Snippets\n+\n+Code snippets must be taken from a compilable source code file (e.g. java, cs, js, etc).\n+We use the `include` feature of asciidoc.\n+Source code files are located in the `docs/_docs/code-snippets/{language}` folders.\n+\n+\n+To add a code snippet to a page, follow these steps:\n+\n+* Create a file in the code snippets directory, e.g. _docs/code-snippets/java/org/apache/ignite/snippets/JavaThinClient.java\n+\n+* Enclose the piece of code you want to include within named tags (see https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#by-tagged-regions). Give the tag a self-evident name.\n+For example:\n++\n+```\n+[source, java]\n+----\n+// tag::clientConnection[]\n+ClientConfiguration cfg = new ClientConfiguration().setAddresses(\"127.0.0.1:10800\");\n+try (IgniteClient client = Ignition.startClient(cfg)) {\n+    ClientCache<Integer, String> cache = client.cache(\"myCache\");\n+    // get data from the cache\n+}\n+// end::clientConnection[]\n+----\n+```\n+\n+* Include the tag in the adoc file:\n++\n+[source, adoc,subs=\"macros\"]\n+----\n+\\include::{javaCodeDir}/JavaThinClient.java[tag=clientConnection,indent=0]\n+----"
