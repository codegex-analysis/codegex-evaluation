However, it reaches the speed limit so in the next step it is not incremented even though the joystick still has a positive value.\n 1. Later, the joystick is set to a negative position for one time unit, making the reference speed to decrease as well.\n+\n+### Some notes\n+\n+[BME MIT](https://www.mit.bme.hu/)\n+\n+***This is the first laboratory excercise of the subject.***"
