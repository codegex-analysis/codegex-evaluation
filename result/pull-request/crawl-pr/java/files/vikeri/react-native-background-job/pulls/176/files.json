The job is then scheduled using the `schedule` function. **By default, the job will not fire while the app is in the foreground**. This is since the job is run on the only JavaScript thread and if running the job when app is in the foreground it would freeze the app. By setting `allowExecutionInForeground` to `true` you allow this behavior.
